# DBS-with-MongoDB
This repository includes my work from the Database Management course, where I focused on using MongoDB as a NoSQL database solution. I completed various assignments that involved designing, querying, and managing data in a document-oriented format. Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience in working with collections and documents, implementing CRUD operations, and utilizing MongoDBâ€™s powerful querying capabilities. This experience helped me understand the flexibility and scalability of NoSQL databases, especially in handling unstructured data.
